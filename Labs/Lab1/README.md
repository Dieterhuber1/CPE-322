# CPE 322
## Lab 1: GHDL and GTKWave
### Introduction:
In this lab I installed GHDL and GTKWave in order to experiment simulating a Half Adder and 4 to 1 Multiplexer in VHDL. Below you will see my documented results from lab 1. Softwares and programs can be found in the Digital System Design Repository([DSD GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kevinwlu/dsd.git))

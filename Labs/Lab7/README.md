# CPE 322
## Lab 7
### Introduction:
Through this lab I learned how to monitor and log CPU performance data such as CPU usage and available memory from my computer using Python. I then sent that data in real time to two platforms, ThingSpeak and Google Sheets.
## ThingSpeak
The first thing I did was create a new channel in ThingSpeak to get my Write API Key. Once I did this I was able to run the command python thingspeak_feed.py in the iot/lesson7 directory.

ThingSpeak then plotted the output data regarding my CPU usage.

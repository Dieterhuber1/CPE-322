# CPE-322
## Lab 5
### Introduction:
In this lab I ran two terminal one to execute pubcpu.py and the other to run subcpu.py. The pubcpu.py published data in the terminal relating to my CPU usage while the subcpu.py subscribed to the pubcpu.py terminal and printed out the data that was coming from it.
# pubcpu.py
Here is the result of the pubcpu.py command:
![pubcpu.py output]()
# subcpu.py
Here is the result of the subcpu.py command:
![subcpu.py output]()

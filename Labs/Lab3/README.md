# CPE 322
## Lab 2
### Introduction:
In this lab I installed different python packages such as jdcal, astral, and geopy. Using these packages I executed a variety of commands to advance my knowledge of python. The executed lines are as followed: </br>
`python julian.py`,
`python date_example.py`,
`python datetime_example.py`,
`python time_example.py`,
`python sun.py "New York"`,
`python moon.py`,
`python coordinates.py "Samuel C. Williams Library"`,
`python address.py "40.74480675, -74.02532861159351"`,
`python cpu.py`,
`python battery.py`,
`python documentstats.py document.txt`.

# CPE 322
## Lab 6
### Introduction:
In this lab I installed Node.js, to run a couple of different java script programs. I also installed Pystache which in order to run a program which is a Python implementation of Mustache.
## Hello-world.js
This command opened a web page that printed "Hello, World!".

## Hello.js
This command opened a web page that printed "Hello World" and each time the page was refreshed the terminal output "response end call done" and "request end event fired".

## http.js
This command opened a web page that counted how many times the page was refreshed and displayed the number on the page and in the terminal.

## Pystache
For this part of the lab I executed say_hello.py in the say_hello.mustache template and it output multiple greeting statements.

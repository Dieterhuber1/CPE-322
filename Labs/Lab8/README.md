## Lab 8
### Introduction:
In this lab I built on previous work from Lab 7 and used Python to organize my data into various plots using different commands and packages. In order to do this I had to convert my google sheet from lab 7 into a CSV file and then combine it into a file with the neccessary programs.

## Installing Python Packages
In order to download all of the needed Python packages I ran the following commands:
- C:\Users\diete>pip install matplotlib pandas opencv-python

- C:\Users\diete\demo>pip install scipy

- C:\Users\diete\demo>pip install scikit-learn

## Data Plots
After installing of the needed Python packages I downloaded a CSV file of my spreadsheet from lab 7 and moved it into a folder with the needed programs, plt_cv2.py and plt_final.py. I then opened these code files to change it to recognize the CSV file and receive all of the porper data from it by changing the titles. Below is the final programs:

![plt_final](https://github.com/Dieterhuber1/CPE-322/blob/main/Labs/Lab8/plt_final.py-2.png)
Finally I changed my directory to the folder I created and ran 'pyhton plt_cv2.py' and 'python plt_final.py'. These commands generated the following plots:
